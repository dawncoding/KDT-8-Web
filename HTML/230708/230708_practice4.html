        "As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me: this
        is exactly the place I've been looking for all my life. A little
        hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I'd always thought of it as a
        secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists.
        I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me
        like a gentle cloud."
